✅ Schema inference
✅ Auto-detect delimiter
✅ Missing value strategies – built-in ways to fill, drop, or flag rows with empty fields.

🔍 Areas for Improvement
Here’s what you could add/fix to make it even better:
✅ Robust quoted fields support
Currently, "Alice, Bob" inside a field will break parsing — add logic to handle quoted values with embedded delimiters.

✅ Escape handling
CSVs often have escaped quotes ("He said ""Hello"""). Right now, this will fail or parse incorrectly.

?? Streaming support
Your createDataFrame still reads the whole file into a vector in memory. If a CSV has millions of rows, it could cause RAM issues. You can make your parser yield rows one by one.

✅ Delimiter detection or config
You give a warning if only one field is identified, but adding automatic delimiter detection (e.g., guessing ,, ;, \t) would make it user-friendly.

5️⃣ Column type consistency checks
Currently, type inference happens on one line. You could analyze multiple rows to infer more reliably.

6️⃣ Error reporting
A syntax error or unexpected data should produce clear messages with line/column info.

7️⃣ Unit tests
Even a few tests in a test.cpp (or Google Test) would make your library production-ready.

8️⃣ Modularity
Consider splitting into header/source files, or making a reusable class CsvParser.

9️⃣ C++ best practices

Avoid global variables like fieldcount or TrueFields — encapsulate them in a class.

Use const where possible.

Replace raw loops with STL algorithms for clarity.
